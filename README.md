# Spanish Pension Reform Model – ICS Transition Simulation

This repository contains the R scripts, input data, and output figures used to simulate the proposed transition of Spain's public pension system from a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model to an Individual Capitalization System (ICS).

## 🧾 Overview

This project accompanies the academic paper titled:

**"From PAYG to Individual Capitalization: A Transition Model for the Spanish Pension System"**

It includes actuarial simulations, fiscal projections, and demographic modeling based on official Spanish statistics and policy assumptions.

## 📁 Repository Structure


## 🔧 How to Use

To reproduce the figures and calculations:

1. Open the scripts in the `/scripts` folder in numerical order:

   - `01_capital_accumulation.R`  
   - `02_fiscal_cost_transition.R`  
   - `03_cohort_distribution.R`  
   - `04_population_projections.R`  
   - `05_sensitivity_analysis.R` (optional)

2. Each script is self-contained and can be run individually.
3. Figures will be generated automatically and saved into `/figures/` if desired.

## 📊 Requirements

- R 4.2 or later
- Base packages only (no external dependencies)

## 📚 Data Sources

- INE (Instituto Nacional de Estadística)
- Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones
- Eurostat (population projections)
- Assumptions based on OECD and World Bank guidelines
